# Activation of basic level categories in the human brain based on different cue types. 

This repository contains a replicated version of an [auditory cue task](https://github.com/jmdudek/XP-Lab2020-What-makes-words-special-Group-35/tree/master/Experiments/02_main) based on Experiment 1A by Edminston & Lupyan (2015).

## Experiment

The experiment uses a 2 (cue type: label, sound) x 2 (match: same, different) x 2 (congruency: congruent, incongruent) within subjects design.

Participants view 144 images of different instances of various basic level categories each after hearing either a spoken form or an environmental sound from a certain category.
They should respond (forced binary choice) whether the instance depicted in the images belong to the same basic level category as the sound they just heard before.

## Background

We replicate Experiment 1A (Pierce Edmiston, Gary Lupyan 2015). The replication is part of a university project in order to acquire skills in conducting and reporting experiments. Furthermore, the general idea of replicating this study is to ensure that the results of the experiment are reliable and credible. 

## Hypotheses

1. We hypothesize that environmental sounds as auditory cues cause longer reaction times than spoken category labels when trying to assess and match their basic-level category to the image that is being displayed. We expect that environmental sounds activate a more specific category instance linking the sound to its likely source, although participants are instructed to only treat it as its basic-level category. This would mean environmental sounds are less effective cues than spoken category labels.
2. We also hypothesize that congruent environmental sounds exhibit a faster reaction time than incongruent ones because there might be less mental effort involved in assigning congruent sounds to their corresponding basic-level category

### Exploratoy Hypotheses

3. We want to explore whether the assumed effect from hypothesis one is still present if we exclude all incongruent trials or whether the hypothesized difference in reaction times is solely caused by them.
4. Furthermore, we want to explore whether the assumed effect from hypothesis one is also present when only considering mismatching trials.
