# Activation of basic level categories in the human brain based on different cue types. - Main Study

This folder contains all the updated code for our main study. We were able to recruite 35 participants.

## Experiment

The experiment uses a 2 (cue type: label, sound) x 2 (match: same, different) x 2 (congruency: congruent, incongruent) within subjects design.

Participants view 144 images of different instances of various basic level categories each after hearing either a spoken form or an environmental sound from a certain category.
They should respond (forced binary choice) whether the instance depicted in the images belong to the same basic level category as the sound they just heard before.
