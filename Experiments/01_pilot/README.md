# Activation of basic level categories in the human brain based on different cue types. - Pilot Study

This folder contains all the code for our pilot study. We recruited 3 participants to see if any bugs or software errors occur and collected feedback to improve the overall design. Moreover, we used this data to write our [analysis script](https://github.com/jmdudek/XP-Lab2020-What-makes-words-special-Group-35/tree/master/Analysis/01_pilot, that we used to analyse the main study.

## Experiment

The experiment uses a 2 (cue type: label, sound) x 2 (match: same, different) x 2 (congruency: congruent, incongruent) within subjects design.

Participants view 144 images of different instances of various basic level categories each after hearing either a spoken form or an environmental sound from a certain category.
They should respond (forced binary choice) whether the instance depicted in the images belong to the same basic level category as the sound they just heard before.
