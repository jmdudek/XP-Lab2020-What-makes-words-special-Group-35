# Activation of basic level categories in the human brain based on different cue types. 

This repository contains an auditory cue task based on the experiment by Edminston & Lupyan (2015).

Edmiston P, Lupyan G. What makes words special? Words as unmotivated cues. Cognition. 2015;143:93-100. doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2015.06.008

## Experiment

The experiment uses a 2 (cue type: label, sound) x 2 (match: same, different) x 2 (congruency: congruent, incongruent) within subjects design.

Participants view 144 images of different instances of various basic level categories each after hearing either a spoken form or an environmental sound from a certain category.
They should respond (forced binary choice) whether the instance depicted in the images belong to the same basic level category as the sound they just heard before.
